# image-builder-rpi For RDBOX. 

forked from [HypriotOS](https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi)  
The major design pattern of this software was abstracted from hypriot's image-builder-rpi, which is subject to the same license.

This repo builds the SD card image with RDBOX based on HypriotOS for the Raspberry Pi 3 series.
You can find released versions of the SD card image here in the GitHub
[releases page](./releases). To build this SD card image we have to

* take the files for the root filesystem from [`os-rootfs`](https://github.com/hypriot/os-rootfs)
* take the empty raw filesystem from [`image-builder-raw`](https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-raw) with the two partitions
* install Docker tools Docker Engine, Docker Compose and Docker Machine
* install kubernetes by kubeadmn.
* Device settings are set so that turtlebot 3 can be used in haste.
* install tools of RDBOX networks applications.
   - transproxy
   - hostapd
   - softether-vpn
   - bridge-util
   - batctl
   - dnsmasq
   - nfs
   - ntp

Feedback is always welcome!

You can build the SD card image locally with Vagrant.

### Setting up build environment

Make sure you have [vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) installed.
Then run the following command to create the Vagrant box and use the Vagrant Docker
daemon. The Vagrant box is needed to run guestfish inside.
Use `export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=virtualbox` to strictly create a VirtualBox VM.

Start vagrant box

```bash
vagrant up
```

Export docker host

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
```

Check you are using docker from inside vagrant

```bash
docker info | grep 'Operating System'
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
```

### Build the SD card image

From here you can just make the SD card image. The output will be written and
compressed to `hypriotos-rpi-v1.10.0.rdbox-v0.0.25.img.zip'

```bash
make sd-image-rdbox
```
